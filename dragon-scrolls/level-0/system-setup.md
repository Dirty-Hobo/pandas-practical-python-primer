# System Setup
Before we begin, we'll need to get some software onto our machines to write
our code and someplace to test it.

### Using a Virtual Machine
In the vast majority of circumstances, the Python code that you write will
eventually run on some flavor of Linux.

Because of this (and because debugging Windows issues is enough to drive you
mad) we'll all be using an Ubuntu virtual machine to run the code that you
create and the class examples.

You have a few different choices for how you want to approach this:

1. Use Vagrant to create a local VM.
2. Create a Ubuntu VM in AWS using a personal account.
3. Utilize nitrous.io to create an VM that is accessible via their console.

Each of these methods has positives / negatives and all of them will take a
little bit of time to get setup.
