# Level One: The Zen & Basics of Python

## Class Setup
Today we're going to start using Python!  Here are a couple of things
to do before each class:
    
- [Grab the latest class updates](../level-0/git-merging-upstream-changes.md)
- [Rebuild the Vagrant VM](../level-0/vagrant-rebuild-vm.md)

### PyCharm Project Setup
* Open a new project folder: `[class-folder]/trainee-area/level-3/using-web-services`
* Set the project interpreter 
![Project Interpreter Settings](level-3-interpreter.png)
* Tell PyCharm where your root source code is for this project so that it will
correctly handle code hinting and imports.  You do this in the `project structure`
area of the settings/preferences.  Make sure to indicate that `trainee-friends-api`
is marked as a `sources` folder.

* Probably restart PyCharm due to software bug in latest version.
