# PyCharm IDE
* 
* For this course, we'll be using a trial version of the most popular Python IDE, [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
* You can download the professional version for free with a 30 day trial.  I'll be contacting them to see about an extension.
* They also have a brand-new educational edition, which I'll check to out to how it might meet our needs.

## Training Tasks
1. Install Pycharm
2. Ensure that you've downloaded your copy of the training repo.
